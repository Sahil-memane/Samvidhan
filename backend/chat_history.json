        "response": "India and Pakistan are two neighboring countries that share a complex and often contentious relationship. They both gained independence from British colonial rule in 1947, and since then, their histories have been intertwined. The two countries have fought multiple wars, including the Indo-Pakistani War of 1947-48, the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965, and the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971. The Kashmir conflict, which has its roots in the partition of British India in 1947, remains a major source of tension between India and Pakistan.\n\nThe relationship between India and Pakistan is governed by various bilateral agreements, including the Lahore Declaration of 1999 and the Comprehensive Dialogue Process initiated in 2004. Both countries are members of international organizations such as the United Nations and the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC), and they have cooperated in various areas, including trade, culture, and sports. However, the relationship between India and Pakistan remains complex, with ongoing disputes over issues such as terrorism, human rights, and water resources.\n\nIn terms of their constitutional systems, both India and Pakistan have federal parliamentary republics, with a president as the head of state and a prime minister as the head of government. However, their constitutional structures and political systems have some significant differences. For example, India's Constitution is longer and more detailed than Pakistan's Constitution, and it includes a more extensive list of fundamental rights and duties. Pakistan's Constitution, on the other hand, emphasizes the role of Islam in governance and society.\n\nIn summary, India and Pakistan share a complicated history, with both similarities and differences in their constitutional systems and political relationships. While they have cooperated in various areas, ongoing disputes and tensions continue to shape their relationship.",

The Act provides a mechanism for filing RTI applications, and it requires public authorities to provide information within a specific time frame, usually 30 days.\n\nThe RTI Act also provides for certain exemptions to protect sensitive information, such as information that would cause a breach of privacy or harm national security.
